# Weather-Dashboard
## Decription


This project was used to better skills with creating and using elements in Javascript, as well as take in local storage input, but mainly it was to get used to fetching data from another source(WeatherAPI). I learned that when fetching, you have to catch incase things go wrong, also that everything that needs an api-key makes things just break all the time because of permissions and paywalls.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

Writing into the text box and hitting the search button will bring up the current weather for that location as well as showing you the weather for the rest of the week.
